# dotfiles

Nothing special, you've probably seen similar dotfiles around the way.

These have only been tested on a 10.8.2 Retina Macbook Pro.

## Prerequisities

* XCode Tools
* Ruby
* Vim (7.3+)

## Installation

1. `curl -L https://github.com/gaahrdner/dotfiles/raw/master/bootstrap.sh | sh`
2. Celebrate with an adult beverage of your choice.

## TODO

1. Investigate using prezto instead of oh-my-zsh, for speed.
2. Clean up vim setup.
3. Colorize all the things.
